/// to points each time it is given a radius.

/// A bead is a Verlet particle exactly like a rope node — it carries its position
/// and its previous position, and gravity and damping act on it the same way — with
/// one extra constraint: it lives on the cord. Each step the particle is integrated
/// freely, then projected back onto the curve, which is what makes it lag behind a
/// whipping rope and catch up afterwards instead of being glued to a fixed point.
///
/// The knot it is threaded against keeps it from sliding away: the projected
/// position is pulled back toward its rest place on the cord and hard-limited to a
/// short travel either side, so a bead slides during motion and never migrates.
