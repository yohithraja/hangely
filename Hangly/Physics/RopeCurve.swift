/// The rope is drawn as a quadratic spline through the node midpoints rather than as
/// a polyline, so anything that has to sit *on* the cord — a bead — must be placed on
/// that same curve, not on the underlying chain. This builds the spline, flattens it
/// once, and answers three questions: where is the point this far along, how far
/// along is the point nearest here, and what does the curve look like up to a cut.
///
/// The curve runs the whole chain, down to the charm's centre. The cord that is
/// actually drawn stops short of that, at the knot where the charm's own artwork
/// takes over, which is a cut at a given arc length rather than a shorter curve.
///
/// Flattening rather than solving analytically because the answers are needed a few
/// hundred times a second and need to be cheap, not exact: four samples per segment
/// puts the error far below a pixel at the sizes a charm is drawn.
